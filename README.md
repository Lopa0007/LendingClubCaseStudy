## General Information
This project aims to identify the attributes that will indicate risky loan applicants who will likely to default. Once, such attributes are identified, same will be checked for future loan applications to know whether the applicant will likely to pay or run away with the money they owe. This will help to reduce the credit loss the lenders will face due to potential defaulters.The analysis is done on data of loans issued by company Lending Club. Only the approved loans which are issued on or between year 2007 to 2011 are included in this study. 



## Conclusions
- Multiple factors such as loan terms, amount funded, interests, applicant's public profile, annual income etc are identified which are behind loan default. 
- More recent data can be analyzed to get recent trend of default. It has also been observed that the California has largest share of loan applications being the most populous state in US with a strong reputation for innovative businesses. However, Nebraska is showing highest rate of defaults, although it's economy performed better than other states during the great recession (2007-2009), this needs further investigation.
