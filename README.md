## General Information
This project aims to identify the attributes that will indicate risky loan applicants who will likely to default. Once, such attributes are identified, same will be checked for future loan applications to know whether the applicant will likely to pay or run away with the money they owed. This will help to reduce tye credit loss the lenders will face due to potential defaulters.The analysis is done on data of loans issued by company Lending Club. Only the approved loans which are issued on or between year 2007 to 2011 are included in this study. 



## Conclusions
- Multiple factors such as loan terns, amount funded, interests, applicant's public profile, annual income etc are identified which are behind loan default. 
- More recent data can be analyzed to get recent trend of default, Also, it has been seen that the California has largest share of loan application, which is very intuitive as it has a strong reputation for innovative businesses and is also the most populous state in the US. However, Nebraska is showing highest rate of defaults, which needs further investigation.
